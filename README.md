## Idea and Motivation:
In this puzzle game you have to find your way out of 15 different mazes. There are 3 worlds with 5 levels each. Every world has its own little mechanic. Choose your way wisely, because there might be no return. Also try to collect as many stars as possible so you'll be able to buy every skin in the game!

This is the sequel our (late) submission to the [Godot Wild Jam #69][1]

## Controls:
You can control the astronaut by using the WASD/Arrow Keys on your keyboard or a controller (Xbox, PS4/5, Nintendo Switch). 
Additionally, there is the option to reset the stage, just in case you find yourself trapped in the void.
